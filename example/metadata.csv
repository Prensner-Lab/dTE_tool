# Project title,CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies Eif4g2 as a novel regulator of CD8+ T cell dysfunction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Experiment type,knockdown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Project description,CD8+ T cells become dysfunctional when exposed to chronic antigen stimulation during cancer. The genetic mechanisms controlling dysfunction remain poorly understood. To address this gap we have developed an ex vivo restimulation model that recapitulates features of CD8+ T cell dysfunction seen within the tumor microenvironment. By coupling this system with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screening we have identified eIF4G2 a non-canonical protein translation factor which may play a novel role in the progression of CD8+ T cells to a dysfunctional state. We hope to identify the specific translation targets of eIF4G2 in CD8+ T cells through ribosome profiling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
